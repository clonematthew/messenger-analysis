## Facebook Messenger Messages Analysis

An absolute mouthful, I know.

The purpose of this project is to create a program that can allow a user to perform interesting and insightful analysis into their Facebook messenger data, without having to jump through lots and lots of programming hoops.
This is a project I have attempted many times in a past few years, but I've only really managed to make meaningful progress recently.

# Current Features

Currently the program is capable of turning a jumble of .json files into a single .csv file, and then counting the number of messages exchanged per day. It can also generate a rolling average for this data and display it on the same graph as the unaveraged data. 

# Future Features

1. Analyse the % of messages sent per person
2. Analyse how the % of messages sent per person changes over time
3. Analyse how the number of messages sent relates to time of the day
4. Analyse the content of the messages; most common words, phrases etc 
5. Emoji analysis?
6. Display multiple sets of data on a single graph (e.g messages shared with 2,3 + people per day graph)
7. Number of words per message
8. Average number of messages per day
9. Analyse how the number of messages relates to the day of the week
10. Sentiment analysis?
